# UT AMW's website
Files for our website on the math server (see profile for link).

## Why?
1. We can add notes to lines of code for future officers to know why/how we did what we did in the code, and
2. We can't download *anything* on the math lab computers and SSH is really tricky.
   Update: We found out we CAN download files onto the math lab computers, but we CANNOT install anything. If you try, it gets reported.

Re #2, this is why our website is historically handmade instead of set up with a nice React framework or a website-generator[^1]. Otherwise, we'd have to use another URL for our website. We might actually be able to set up 302 redirection on the math server and host on GitHub, but that takes more effort to maintain both long-term and short-term.

[^1]: Also because Tara doesn't like website generators (it's more fulfilling to make it from scratch and not have a "Made with --" at the bottom).

## TODOs
- update the photos folder on the UT math machines to reflect officer photos
- add dark mode
