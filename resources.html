        <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/" target="_blank">Research Experiences for Undergrads*</a>
        <p class="resource-description">
            An REU Site consists of a group of ten or so undergraduates who work in the research programs of the host institution. Each student is associated with a specific research project, where they work closely with the faculty and other researchers. Students are granted stipends and, in many cases, assistance with housing and travel. Undergraduate students supported with NSF funds must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States or its possessions. <br><br>
            *This is NOT LIMITED TO MATH, but it is most relevant to this section!

        <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Open Courseware*</a>
        <p class="resource-description">
            MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) is a free, publicly accessible, openly-licensed digital collection of high-quality teaching and learning materials, presented in an easily accessible format. Like Coursera, except completely free. <br><br>

        <p class="resource-description">
            Notes (free and downloadable) that Dr. Paul Dawkins used to teach Algebra, Calculus (I, II and III), and Differential Equations at Lamar University.

        <p class="resource-description">
            The Association for Women in Mathematics has administered the NSF-AWM Travel Grant Program for Women since 1988, supporting both travel to domestic or foreign research conferences and, more recently, longer-term visits with a mentor.

        <a href="https://awm-math.org/programs/mentor-network/" target="_blank">Mentor Network</a>
        <p class="resource-description">
            Students who are interested in mathematics or are pursuing careers in mathematics are matched with mentors, both men and women. The network is intended to link mentors with a variety of groups: recent PhDâ€™s, graduate students, undergraduates, high school and grade school students, and teachers. Matching is based on common interests in careers in academics or industry, math education, balance of career and family, or general mathematical interests.

        <h2 id="ut-resources">UT AUSTIN</h2>
        <!-- Dr. Austin, Title IX, DRP, UT Catalyst, UT NSC -->
        <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jmann/" target="_blank">Dr. Austin</a>
        <p class="resource-description">
            Dr. Jennifer K. Mann Austin is both our official club advisor as well as the Undergraduate Mathematics Faculty Advisor (and an Associate Professor of Instruction, so she may be your professor this semester)! Dr. Austin is a wonderful person to talk to, be it social or academic advice you seek.
        </p>
        <a href="https://titleix.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Title IX</a>
        <p class="resource-description">
            The Title IX Office seeks to provide leadership pertaining to the Title IX regulations, state laws, and University policies, as well as develop and implement best practices for prevention, training, resources, and support services at The University of Texas at Austin.
            <br><br>
            Past members have found it more comfortable to talk to Dr. Austin on such subjects. Know that Dr. Austin is a required Title IX reporter and she respects you as a person.
        </p>
        <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/drp/" target="_blank">Directed Reading Program</a>
        <p class="resource-description">
            DRP is run by our wonderful graduate students in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin! DRP pairs undergraduates with graduate student mentors to undertake independent projects in mathematics. Any undergraduate may apply for DRP and upon acceptance is assigned a graduate mentor. Together, they agree on a project, which can be based on reading a book or article (but the project is not limited to such things). The applications are available each fall and spring semester in the first or second week of classes.
        </p>
        <a href="https://utcatalyst.org/grade-distributions" target="_blank">UT Catalyst Grade Distributions</a>
        <p class="resource-description">
            Created by the Natural Sciences Council, the grade distributions offer aggregate data over past semesters (since Fall 2013) to help you make more informed decisions for registration. All the grade distributions data is received from the university and is not self-reported. In accordance with FERPA regulations, classes with fewer than 10 students may not have grade distributions available.
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.utnsc.org/" target="_blank">UT Natural Sciences Council</a>
        <p class="resource-description">
           The Student Government, the Senate of College Councils, and the Graduate Student Assembly are the three legislative student organizations at the University of Texas at Austin and represent UT students all across campus. The Natural Sciences Council is a member of the Senate of College Councils and represents the academic interests of College of Natural Sciences Students through legislation.
