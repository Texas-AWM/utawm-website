                        UT STEM Girl Day gives K-8th graders "an opportunity to explore STEM through 
                        grade-appropriate, hands-on activities" hosted by STEM enthusiasts from diverse 
                        occupations and roles.

                        Our members helped in constructing fun, interactive activities for families to play. 
                        And on the day of the event, they volunteered around the clock to manage 
                        stations, all while teaching children important mathematical or scientific concepts.
                        You can look for this event in February on our mailing list and Discord.

                    <p>
                        We started this program to give interested highschoolers the experience of 
                        what a Day in the Life is like for a math major at UT. In this program, the 
                        highschoolers would follow their respective student guide around campus for a
                        day, with food provided by AWM. This also gives high schoolers a chance to
                        ask the student guide questions concerning the major from a first-hand perspective.

                        Organized by our beloved club sponsor, Dr. Austin, Girl Scouts STEM Exploration Day
                        was held to give girls a chance to have hands-on experience with math concepts
                        seen naturally but hardly noticed by the untrained eye. This event was fully supported
                        by AWM volunteers who aren't afraid of having fun.
