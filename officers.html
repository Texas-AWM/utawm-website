                        Hello everybody! I'm a Math major at UT pursuing a minor in Computer Science. 
                        While I am focused on data science and statistics,  I also enjoy many creative endeavors, 
                        such as drawing and painting, as much as solving problems. I don't believe in staying 
                        within a single paradigm and AWM reflects that, welcoming any and all people to become 
                        our new friends in this home we've created at UT. My favorite color is pink and I'm 
                        obsessed with desert rain frogs.

                        Hi! I am a math major also pursuing a UTEACH certificate here at UT. 
                        I play pickleball, volleyball and I love cats! For me, AWM has been a warm, 
                        welcoming place with friendly faces, yummy snacks, and fun games.

                        Hello! My name is Anouka Saha and I am currently a junior mathematics major. 
                        I have been a part of this organization since fall of my freshman year, and am so 
                        excited to see where AWM goes this semester and beyond. Outside of AWM I am a peer 
                        mentor for the EvoDevOmics FRI research stream, and enjoy reading books, playing the 
                        piano, and singing.
