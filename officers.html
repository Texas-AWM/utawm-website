                        Hello everybody! I'm a Math major at UT pursuing a minor in Computer Science. 
                        While I am focused on data science and statistics,  I also enjoy many creative endeavors, 
                        such as drawing and painting, as much as solving problems. I don't believe in staying 
                        within a single paradigm and AWM reflects that, welcoming any and all people to become 
                        our new friends in this home we've created at UT. My favorite color is pink and I'm 
                        obsessed with desert rain frogs.

                        Hi! I am a math major also pursuing a UTEACH certificate here at UT. 
                        I play pickleball, volleyball and I love cats! For me, AWM has been a warm, 
                        welcoming place with friendly faces, yummy snacks, and fun games.

                        Hello! My name is Anouka Saha and I am currently a junior mathematics major. 
                        I have been a part of this organization since fall of my freshman year, and am so 
                        excited to see where AWM goes this semester and beyond. Outside of AWM I am a peer 
                        mentor for the EvoDevOmics FRI research stream, and enjoy reading books, playing the 
                        piano, and singing.

                        Hi! My name is Mitali and I am a forth-year math major doing actuarial sciences and a 
                        minor in business. This is actually my third major at UT (and my favorite). I have been 
                        in AWM for more than two years and I am so grateful for all of the amazing friendships I 
                        have made through the org! In my free time, I enjoy playing card games and watching trashy 
                        reality tv. Also, most importantly I am team Edward.

                    <p>
                        Howdy! I entered UT as a Math major who thought programming was cool but was scared of Computer 
                        Science majors. I still love math, but I love CS a *tad* bit more, hence my internal transfer to 
                        become a CS major. Regardless, AWM is my home and I've had so much joy playing Avalon on Wednesdays 
                        to the point where my friend group is almost all AWMies. My favorite color is green, favorite animal 
                        is the chicken (I have 7), and favorite shoes are black boots. :)
