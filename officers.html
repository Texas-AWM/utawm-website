                        Hi! I am a math major also pursuing a UTEACH certificate here at UT.
                        I play pickleball, volleyball and I love cats! For me, AWM has been a warm,
                        welcoming place with friendly faces, yummy snacks, and fun games.

                        Hi! My name is Amanda Zhang, and I am a mathematics major also pursing a data science minor and a CS certificate.
                        I joined AWM fall semester of my freshman year, and I have found many friendships within this club!
                        In my free time, I enjoy dancing, eating, and especially sleeping.

                        Hello! I’m Shreya Nandakumar. I’m a junior math major, but I’m graduating this year, so I guess I’m kind of a senior too. I’m also working on a computer science and data science certificate. My most favorite thing to do is doing nothing.
