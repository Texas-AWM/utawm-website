                        Hello! My name is Anouka Saha and I am currently a senior mathematics major.
                        I have been a part of this organization since fall of my freshman year, and
                        am so excited to see where AWM goes! Outside of AWM, I am a peer mentor for 
                        the EvoDevOmics FRI research stream and enjoy reading books.

                        bio: Hi! I am a math major with a focus in pure math also pursuing cs minor! 
                        I play pickleball, volleyball and I love cats! For me, AWM has been a warm,
                         welcoming place with friendly faces, yummy snacks, and fun games.

                        Hello! I’m Shreya Nandakumar. I’m a junior math major, but I’m graduating this year, 
                        so I guess I’m kind of a senior too. I’m also working on a computer science and data 
                        science certificate. Additionally, I serve as a mentor for the Big Data in Biology FRI 
                        stream. My most favorite thing to do is doing nothing.

                        Hey! I am a junior mathematics major also pursing an Elements of Computing certificate. 
                        My main focus is on data science, analytics, as well as software development! 
                        I've found AWM to be an amazing place to make meaningful connections within your major. 
                        Outside of it, I also design for an on-campus arts magazine, and enjoy reading, hiking, 
                        and being with friends.

                        Hi! My name is Amanda Zhang, and I am a mathematics major also pursing a data science minor and a CS certificate. 
                        I joined AWM fall semester of my freshman year, and I have found many friendships within this club!
                        In my free time, I enjoy dancing, eating, and especially sleeping.
