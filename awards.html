                    <p>
                        This year, AWM had a very successful T-shirt sale with the PMA Elevator shirt design. 
                        With these funds, AWM has started initiatives to improve the PMA building and management, 
                        including efforts to improve bathrooms and provide baskets of pads and tampons in bathrooms within the building.

                    <p>
                        Each year, the Award for Fundraising/Sustainability recognizes a student chapter 
                        for an innovative and successful funding model that provides financial support for 
                        its activities or otherwise sustains the student chapter. Such a model could include 
                        organizing review sessions prior to exams, soliciting support from local industry 
                        sponsors, writing proposals for university or government grants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The UT Austin AWM Chapter was recognized for successfully fundraising from multiple sources:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a student government fund</li>
                            <li>Major League Hacking&#39;s (MLH) Pizza Fund</li>
                            <li>and a t-shirt sale incorporating iconography that was special to the local
                                math and science community.</li>
                        </ul>
                        We used these funds tosupport professional development events for undergraduate
                        students at UT-Austin that included an REU/internship workshop, a graduate
                        student panel, and multiple technical workshops, and to run a variety of
                        outreach events at the k-12 and undergraduate level.

                    <p>
                        Student Government allocates funding to student organizations in order to "help 
                        support events and initiatives that improve the student experience, and/or contribute 
                        to campus communities."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this fund, we ordered merchandise to advertise our student organization,
                        especially emphasizing the inclusivity and welcoming nature of our club as well
                        as incorporating UT AWM's beloved mascot, Awmie the Armadillo.

                    <p>
                        Major League Hacking, along with their partners created the Pizza Fund to support 
                        "in-person meetups, workshops, and even mini-hackathons".

                    <p>
                        We used this fund to host a workshop where our members were taught introductory
                        HTML. Members were also exposed to useful services, such as Github Pages, so
                        that they can have the tools needed to create their own detailed website from scratch.
